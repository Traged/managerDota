        <b><strong>How it works?</strong></b> <br>
        If you know games like football manager, where you make up your own team and then you compete
        this happens to be similiar thing. You made up you own team with players you will choose and then
        you will compete against other players. (Mind that this is Alfa version)</div></div>

    <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-body">
            <b><strong>Will there be more features? </strong></b> <br>
            Of course, there will be more. I have many ideas, and I will also listen to yours.
            However as you should know its also about time. ( Time is money guys)
            I want to say, if you will donate something, it will not only mean much to me but also you
            will get something from it. (new feature in shorter time, new domain etc.)
        </div></div>

                <b><strong>Can I help with developing?  </strong></b> <br>
                Of course, if you know things. Or you are willing to do some stuff like write some
                bios for players, do some design. There is always smething to improve and I will be glad
                if anyone will try something.
